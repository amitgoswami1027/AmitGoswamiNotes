# Polyglot Persistence System
If we have ACID requirements like for a financial transaction, MySQL would fit best. On the other hand, when we need fast data access, we would pick Memcache or when we are okay with data denormalization and it being eventually consistent but need a fast highly available database, a NoSQL solution would fit best.

## Key Value Store
For low latency access of the frequently accessed data, we would need to implement a cache using a key-value store like Redis or Memcached. We can use the same key-value data store to store user sessions in a distributed system achieving a consistent state across the clusters.

## Wide Column Database
To understand user behavior, we need to set up an analytics system to analyze the big data generated by the users. We can do this using a wide-column database like Cassandra or HBase.

# Document-Oriented Database
Document-oriented databases are the leading types of NoSQL databases. They store data in a document-oriented model in independent documents. The data is generally semi-structured and stored in a JSON-like format. The data model is similar to the data model of our application code, so itâ€™s easier to store and query data for developers. Some of the popular document-oriented stores used in the industry are MongoDB, CouchDB, OrientDB, Google Cloud Datastore, and Amazon DocumentDB.

# Time Series Database
Time-series databases are optimized for tracking and persisting data that is continually read and written in the system over a period of time.
It is the data containing data points associated with the occurrence of events with respect to time. These data points are tracked, monitored, and aggregated based on specific business logic. Time-series data is generally ingested from IoT devices, self-driving vehicles, industry sensors, social networks, stock market financial data, etc.

Studying data streaming-in from applications helps us track the behavior of the system as a whole. It allows us to study user patterns, anomalies, and how things change over time.Time-series data is primarily used for running analytics and deducing conclusions. It helps the stakeholders make future business decisions by looking at the analytics results. Running analytics enables us to evolve our product continually.

Regular databases are not built to handle time-series data. With the advent of IoT, these databases are getting pretty popular and adopted by the big guns in the industry.

Some of the popular time-series databases used in the industry are Influx DB, Timescale DB, Prometheus, etc.
