# The rise of machine learning
Machine learning (ML) has been one of the fastest-growing fields, and it is projected to grow from $7.3B in 2020 to $30.6B in 2024. Machine learning aims at solving a multitude of complex problems and has seen rapid progress in several areas such as speech understanding, visual understanding, search ranking, credit card fraud detection, and so on.
