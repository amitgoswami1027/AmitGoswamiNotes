# BEHAVIOURAL INTERVIEWS

## THE PURPOSE OF BEHAVIOURAL INTERVIEWS
Past behavior is a predictor of future behavior. When preparing for interviews, it is very common for people to gloss over the behavioral portion and just focus on fine-tuning their applicable knowledge. However, interviewers also want to know if you are someone they would want to work with. They may be wondering: 

When preparing for interviews, it is very common for people to gloss over the behavioral portion and just focus on fine-tuning their applicable knowledge. However, interviewers also want to know if you are someone they would want to work with. They may be wondering:
* Are you calm under pressure?
* Are you comfortable giving formal presentations?
* Can you respectfully give your boss bad news?

#### What interviewers are really assessing
So, what are interviewers really assessing during behavioral interviews? Depending on the job, it may be your ability to work in teams and collaborate with others. The culture may value knowledge sharing or being a good motivator. They might prioritize self-awareness, growth mindset, ambition, humility, comfort with ambiguity, or risk tolerance.

Whether you will be pioneering a new role or backfilling an existing one, the interviewer knows more about the job than you do. They also know more about the existing team and organization. Therefore, they may be listening for certain capabilities and behaviors that will be more likely to make a new hire successful.

## PREPARING OR HOMEWORK
### Researching (Forschung) the Organization
Note: Interviewers will listen for the words used in organizations’ values statements in your answers. Refer to this list as you practice answers to behavioral questions. If the organization’s values are consistent with your own, your answers are more likely to reflect that. If the organization’s values are inconsistent with your own, this may be a sign that their culture is not right for you.

### List Organizational Values
Questions to ask yourself 
* What industry does the organization operate in?
* Who are the competitors?
* What share of the market do they have?
* What are the aspects of their brand? Do they have a logo? Colors? Tagline(s)?
* What is their mission and values?
* What are the most important products and services?
* What do customers say?
* Is this an old industry or new industry?
* What is the size of the industry with respect to the national or global economy?
* Does the organization compete on price or quality?
* How do they differentiate their products or services?

### Create a List of Experiences
Now it’s time to think of stories from your own life that you can develop into rich and meaningful responses to behavioral questions.
What experiences do you know that you absolutely want to share? Imagine a movie is being made about your life and you get to choose the scenes that show you in the best possible light. What would you choose?

When you run out of ideas, use the prompts below to help you remember more examples. Consider:
* Times when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success.
* Times when you fixed something that wasn’t working.
* A time when you had to make a challenging decision.
* A time when you had to influence a leader or team.
* Times when you got surprised by something or had overlooked something.
* Times when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution.
* A time when you failed but learned.
* A time when you had to defuse​ an escalating situation.

### The STAR Technique
The STAR technique is a structured way of responding to behavioral questions in an interview. If you explain each experience with this technique, you will be able to communicate your skills in a fully fleshed out way that will help the interviewer learn about you.

* Situation. Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.
* Task. What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? What were your responsibilities in that situation?
* Action. Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on “I," not “we”.
* Result. Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

#### Sample STAR Response 
Sample Star Response: “Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?”
* S: There was a team member in a project I was managing whose pace was lagging behind the others.
* T: We were in the hyper-growth phase of a company project, so each member had to do research and produce a certain amount of content per week. The goal was to create 50 internet articles per month in order to bring more traffic to the platform.
* A: We got together to address the issue. I explained that although he was falling behind, he could still improve by making a few adjustments to his strategy. I also encouraged him to collaborate with other members if he was struggling with something.
* R: His productivity increased and he felt more confident in his work which led to the team meeting the monthly quota, and to him producing some great ideas.

#### Practice STAR Response 
Which of the four parts of STAR is missing from this answer and how does this missing part negatively affect the answer’s overall strength?
* Question: Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?
* Answer: During my junior and senior years of college, I worked at a Poké place that was run by a couple. I worked as a dishwasher, chopper, custodian, and general cleaner. The store was very small, so the three of us were the only ones working. One especially busy day, I was tasked with making a Poké bowl for a customer. Making a Poké bowl is super simple, but today was very busy and making a bowl (on top of my other responsibilities) made things quite stressful. Since I was so busy, I rushed with making the bowl and finished it quickly. When I was walking back to the kitchen, however, I hit the bowl and it flew onto the ground. The bowl was ruined and I had to remake the bowl.
* Instructions: The act of remaking the bowl seems like it satisfies the “result” section of STAR, but does it really? A better “result” might be what you would do differently in the future.

#### Avoid talking in absolutes
Witnesses are advised to avoid saying things like “never” or “always”. Such phrases are too precise and can trigger skepticism. Instead, express your preferences, intentions, and actions in a natural way that gives you some room for things out of your control. Here are some ideas:
* I’m always on time → I prefer being on time whenever possible.
* I’m never insensitive → I work hard to give feedback in a constructive way that considers personal feelings.
* That’s everything that happened → Those are the examples I can recall right now.

#### Be a Cultural Anthropologist
Cultural anthropology is the study of human cultures. A cultural anthropologist may visit or live with people in a different culture to learn all about that culture from the inside. Similarities and differences between cultures can be compared and studied. When you’re interviewing with several organizations, you have a chance to do this as well (if only for an hour or two at a time).

Anthropologists study the artifacts, languages, tools, rituals, traditions, and behaviors of a culture. You have an opportunity to do this when you interview. Think of yourself as a scientist and collect data for later comparison and examination.

What other behaviors do you notice? Do people greet each other by name as you’re being escorted around the office? Are you introduced to others? Is there joking and laughter, or a quiet tone for deep concentration? What is the energy like?

If you think of yourself as a cultural anthropologist and collect data during interviews, you will be better equipped to make a choice about a job offer or choose between many!
