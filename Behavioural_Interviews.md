# BEHAVIOURAL INTERVIEWS

## THE PURPOSE OF BEHAVIOURAL INTERVIEWS
Past behavior is a predictor of future behavior. When preparing for interviews, it is very common for people to gloss over the behavioral portion and just focus on fine-tuning their applicable knowledge. However, interviewers also want to know if you are someone they would want to work with. They may be wondering: 

When preparing for interviews, it is very common for people to gloss over the behavioral portion and just focus on fine-tuning their applicable knowledge. However, interviewers also want to know if you are someone they would want to work with. They may be wondering:
* Are you calm under pressure?
* Are you comfortable giving formal presentations?
* Can you respectfully give your boss bad news?

### What interviewers are really assessing
So, what are interviewers really assessing during behavioral interviews? Depending on the job, it may be your ability to work in teams and collaborate with others. The culture may value knowledge sharing or being a good motivator. They might prioritize self-awareness, growth mindset, ambition, humility, comfort with ambiguity, or risk tolerance.

Whether you will be pioneering a new role or backfilling an existing one, the interviewer knows more about the job than you do. They also know more about the existing team and organization. Therefore, they may be listening for certain capabilities and behaviors that will be more likely to make a new hire successful.

## PREPARING OR HOMEWORK
### Researching (Forschung) the Organization
Note: Interviewers will listen for the words used in organizations’ values statements in your answers. Refer to this list as you practice answers to behavioral questions. If the organization’s values are consistent with your own, your answers are more likely to reflect that. If the organization’s values are inconsistent with your own, this may be a sign that their culture is not right for you.

### List Organizational Values
Questions to ask yourself 
* What industry does the organization operate in?
* Who are the competitors?
* What share of the market do they have?
* What are the aspects of their brand? Do they have a logo? Colors? Tagline(s)?
* What is their mission and values?
* What are the most important products and services?
* What do customers say?
* Is this an old industry or new industry?
* What is the size of the industry with respect to the national or global economy?
* Does the organization compete on price or quality?
* How do they differentiate their products or services?

### Create a List of Experiences
Now it’s time to think of stories from your own life that you can develop into rich and meaningful responses to behavioral questions.
What experiences do you know that you absolutely want to share? Imagine a movie is being made about your life and you get to choose the scenes that show you in the best possible light. What would you choose?

When you run out of ideas, use the prompts below to help you remember more examples. Consider:
* Times when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success.
* Times when you fixed something that wasn’t working.
* A time when you had to make a challenging decision.
* A time when you had to influence a leader or team.
* Times when you got surprised by something or had overlooked something.
* Times when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution.
* A time when you failed but learned.
* A time when you had to defuse​ an escalating situation.

### The STAR Technique
The STAR technique is a structured way of responding to behavioral questions in an interview. If you explain each experience with this technique, you will be able to communicate your skills in a fully fleshed out way that will help the interviewer learn about you.

* Situation. Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.
* Task. What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? What were your responsibilities in that situation?
* Action. Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on “I," not “we”.
* Result. Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

#### Sample STAR Response 
Sample Star Response: “Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?”
* S: There was a team member in a project I was managing whose pace was lagging behind the others.
* T: We were in the hyper-growth phase of a company project, so each member had to do research and produce a certain amount of content per week. The goal was to create 50 internet articles per month in order to bring more traffic to the platform.
* A: We got together to address the issue. I explained that although he was falling behind, he could still improve by making a few adjustments to his strategy. I also encouraged him to collaborate with other members if he was struggling with something.
* R: His productivity increased and he felt more confident in his work which led to the team meeting the monthly quota, and to him producing some great ideas.

#### Practice STAR Response 
Which of the four parts of STAR is missing from this answer and how does this missing part negatively affect the answer’s overall strength?
* Question: Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?
* Answer: During my junior and senior years of college, I worked at a Poké place that was run by a couple. I worked as a dishwasher, chopper, custodian, and general cleaner. The store was very small, so the three of us were the only ones working. One especially busy day, I was tasked with making a Poké bowl for a customer. Making a Poké bowl is super simple, but today was very busy and making a bowl (on top of my other responsibilities) made things quite stressful. Since I was so busy, I rushed with making the bowl and finished it quickly. When I was walking back to the kitchen, however, I hit the bowl and it flew onto the ground. The bowl was ruined and I had to remake the bowl.
* Instructions: The act of remaking the bowl seems like it satisfies the “result” section of STAR, but does it really? A better “result” might be what you would do differently in the future.

#### Avoid talking in absolutes
Witnesses are advised to avoid saying things like “never” or “always”. Such phrases are too precise and can trigger skepticism. Instead, express your preferences, intentions, and actions in a natural way that gives you some room for things out of your control. Here are some ideas:
* I’m always on time → I prefer being on time whenever possible.
* I’m never insensitive → I work hard to give feedback in a constructive way that considers personal feelings.
* That’s everything that happened → Those are the examples I can recall right now.

#### Be a Cultural Anthropologist
Cultural anthropology is the study of human cultures. A cultural anthropologist may visit or live with people in a different culture to learn all about that culture from the inside. Similarities and differences between cultures can be compared and studied. When you’re interviewing with several organizations, you have a chance to do this as well (if only for an hour or two at a time).

Anthropologists study the artifacts, languages, tools, rituals, traditions, and behaviors of a culture. You have an opportunity to do this when you interview. Think of yourself as a scientist and collect data for later comparison and examination.

What other behaviors do you notice? Do people greet each other by name as you’re being escorted around the office? Are you introduced to others? Is there joking and laughter, or a quiet tone for deep concentration? What is the energy like?

If you think of yourself as a cultural anthropologist and collect data during interviews, you will be better equipped to make a choice about a job offer or choose between many!

## PATTERNS FOR BEHAVIOUR INTERVIEWS

### Prior Experience Questions

* Sample Question -01 : Tell me about a time when you experienced failure.
* Response: “I was leading the implementation of new shipping and inventory management systems for 35 manufacturing plants. During our pilot plant implementation, we had major hardware failures with the scanning solution installed on forklifts. The failures were so bad that we had to resort to manual processes to keep the business going. This required us to double our staffing during the pilot. I delayed further rollouts by 8 weeks to solve the hardware problems, increasing costs. The failures during the pilot created concerns with our stakeholders that we had to overcome.”
Take a look at this answer again. Did you notice how many times “we” was used versus “I”? Now, let’s take a look at another version of the same response.
* Alternative Response: " I learned how important it is to take responsibility for a failure as the leader of a team. By taking responsibility, acknowledging the problems, and committing to solutions, I was able to keep the support of the plant leadership. I also remembered that a few of the team members had asked me before the launch about doing more hardware testing and I had dismissed their concerns. I apologized to them and promised to do better going forward. My personal takeaway was to be a better listener and give full consideration to concerns that are brought to my attention."

* Sample Question-02: “When things go wrong, how do you deal with it? Give me an example of a situation you dealt with in a previous role.”
* EM Response: One of my leads sent me a text one night asking me to join a Support call. My team managed the business applications for Acme. It was end-of-month and payroll processing time. Jobs were failing and there was a sense of panic on the call (Situation). I was responsible for the execution of the payroll run within a specific time window (Tasks). I announced myself on the call and asked for a situation report. This is where my military training kicked in. My team is used to me being a laid-back manager, but I find that people calm down when you ask methodical questions and give clear and specific directions. The team was not able to give a clear description of “last known good,” so I started dispatching people to get details and report back. Instead of just verbally reporting, I asked everyone to update a shared doc so that we could all see the knowns and unknowns as they came in (Actions). My team had guessed prematurely that the problem was in the most recent code release, but reviewing all recent changes showed us that there had been a change for scheduled backups that was creating db contention and jobs were timing out (Results). It didn’t take long to solve the problem after that. Being calm under pressure helps other people be calm. I can be easy-going most of the time, but I am still very direct when necessary. When there’s a problem, people like knowing someone is in charge. To avoid panic the next time, I facilitated a post-mortem to document troubleshooting steps and came up with a process to designate a leader during a live issue.

Be ready for these possible follow up questions:

    What’s your onboarding process for new resources?
    How else could you improve processes to prevent a recurrence?
    
* Software Engineer Response : I was working as an App Developer for XYZ Company when a Zero-Day Privilege Elevation vulnerability was discovered. Microsoft issued a patch and we had 6000 Windows servers running in 4 different data centers that all needed to be patched as quickly and efficiently as possible (Situation). It wasn’t my job to patch servers, but the VP asked all of us for ideas to get the work done faster (Tasks). I suggested that several of us could help do validation if the procedure was documented. Others could help with tracking the servers coming in and out of rotation and updating tickets. This freed up the Systems Engineers to do the work that only they could do (Actions). I had never done some of those tasks before, so I had to follow procedures exactly and ask for help if I wasn’t sure about something. I was willing to take directions and learn. I took good notes and helped make the documentation easier to follow (Results). I gained a new appreciation for the Systems and Security Engineers. We worked long hours, but it felt good to pull together. It was also good to know that we could do that again if a serious security issue came up.

Be ready for possible follow up questions:

    How did you manage separation of duties?
    How long did it take overall?

* Project Manager Response: I was given a stretch assignment to lead the turnaround of a troubled project. The team had launched an ecommerce product that was doing great in terms of sales, but taking too many resources to support. Instead of operationalizing a successful project, the team was frustrated and burned out(Situation). I spent the first week interviewing team members one-on-one. During the second week, I decided to attend a weekly Thursday night support call. These calls were scheduled to update the site with new products, offers, and pricing. This was supposed to be a routine maintenance activity, but it was notorious for failures that led to all-nighters for the team. I was listening in to learn about the processes(Tasks). The database job completed as expected with a ‘job ran successfully’ message and we thought it might be a short call. Then, quality-checking revealed missing updates. Re-running the job gave the same result. The software we were using was a third party service. They were on the call, but unsure how to proceed. At this point, I recognized what the team had been telling me. When a problem occurred, the SRE’s and DBA’s were expected to stay on the call until the problem was resolved. This led to wasted time and lots of frustration. Instead, I decided to take a different action(Actions). I confirmed the escalation process with the third party team. It was clear that they needed time to troubleshoot. I told everyone else to go to bed and the Help Desk would contact the engineer on call if their team was needed. I gave the third party engineers instructions to call me directly with updates and confirmed that I would coordinate getting resources on our side when needed.

After 6 hours, the problem was fixed by the third party. I contacted an SRE and DBA on our side to re-run the job and validate(Results). The more important result was that I established my role as a leader who would listen to the team, hold vendors accountable, make decisions, and facilitate problem-solving without wasting their time. I made a lot of fans that night, which was important because I needed every one of them to turn the project around.

Be ready for these possible follow up questions:

    How long did it take to complete the turnaround?
    What were the root causes of the project failure?

* Product Manager Response: The classic scenario is the demo that stops working right before your big presentation. This happened to me when I was at ABC Company(Situation). I was leading the development of a new mobile experience, and we were scheduled to meet with senior leaders to demo our V0 prototype and get approval for V1 funding. We were having issues with it in the hour before the meeting. I was responsible for presenting the business case and the designer was going to run the demo(Tasks). We needed time to get to the meeting, so we left the engineers working on it. I met with one senior leader ahead of time to make sure we had a champion in the room. I knew she expected to see the same demo. I felt a lot of pressure. Ten minutes before the meeting, it still wasn’t working, so I suggested to the designer that we present the storyboard mockup instead(Actions). We had an electronic version that was full of photos and illustrations. I added the customer persona and journey maps to my presentation. The designer and I both focused on creating a narrative centered on our customer and her pain points. I whispered in the ear of our champion when she arrived and told her we had modified our presentation approach, but that the facts were all the same(Results). Our presentation became “asking for advice” about our V0 prototype instead of “asking for approval.” We asked stakeholders for suggestions and they gave us great ideas about go-to-market, monetization, and positioning. In the end, they approved more funding for V1 than our original request. I was reminded of the value of a rough prototype and asking for advice.

Be ready for these possible follw-up questions:

    What would have been different if the prototype had worked perfectly?
    What would you do to prevent this from happening in the future?

### Hypotheticals
Hypotheticals, or “what if” questions, challenge you to demonstrate creativity and confidence; they also allow interviewers to assess your instinctive responses. These scenarios may be realistic, fantastical, or both.

Being ready for hypothetical questions can help you get past personal bias that may affect your interview performance. For example, if you are someone who prefers realism, you may be thrown by questions that ask you to imagine unrealistic scenarios. However, if you know that hypotheticals ​are coming, preparing for them will ensure that you won’t be caught off guard and respond poorly.

Interviewers ask hypothetical questions to learn more about the way you creatively think, process, and react.

* Sample Question: Within a 5-minute time span, the following people come to you asking for help: A V.P. whom you do not regularly interact with, your manager, and a customer. All three say their need is urgent. How do you prioritize them?
(Take a look at this question created by Salifu who is a talent leader at GitHub. He does not answer the question, but instead, he tells you what he is listening for as the interviewer)

### Sample - Hypotheticals -01
* Question: If I were your supervisor and asked you to do something that you disagreed with, what would you do?
* Response: "If my supervisor asked me to do something I disagreed with I would respectfully push back. I would ask questions about the value of the project/feature/task (etc.) and how it would benefit the greater good of users. It’s important to me that I believe in what I’m working on and if I disagree with it, I think that it’s important and appropriate to push back against my management for further explanation.”
* Pro Tip: You can take advantage of hypothetical questions to highlight specific skills that you know will be beneficial to the organization (hence why it is important to do your homework!).


### Sample - Hypotheticals -02
* Question: How would you design a field test for wearable devices used to track dinosaurs in Jurassic Park?
* Response-1: What a fun question! I would do an exhaustive pre-test to maximize the testing that can be done in a safe way. I would assemble a team that includes the animal caretakers and experts, someone from park operations and a device testing expert. I would get as much input as possible from the team I curated. I would plan to test the devices on humans first, then take the trial to the zoo to test on animals that are non-threatening. With a series of graduated testing, we could validate our processes for data collection, support, provisioning, and problem management. Lower level testing could verify device operations within humidity and temperature ranges.
* This response highlights the candidate’s ability to plan and solicit advice from experts.
Response-2: I love this question, Jurassic Park is my favorite movie! I would gather all my friends with pets. We would plan a series of three weekly pet playdates at the city park for 2 hours each. The testing team would arrive at the park early to set up all their equipment and outfit the pets. With each weekly iteration, we would deal with problems or miscalculations that we found. Then, I would talk to my father who works at a construction company that is currently building a high-rise downtown. I would ask if we could put devices on the construction workers and some of the equipment for three straight days. The devices should be exposed to the elements as much as possible. After completing the four tests, I would gather, compare, and analyze the test results with the team.
* This response highlights​ the candidate’s creativity and ability to succeed with limited resources. These talents would be great to highlight if you are interviewing at a small company or start-up.

* RUBIC GUIDELINES
  * Were you able to complete your response in 2-3 minutes?
  * Did you describe your imagined responsibilites and the specific actions you would take?
  * Did you explain “why” you would choose those actions?
  * Did any of your explanations mention values that are important to the organization?
  * Did you share your analytical approach or decision-making process?


## Values-Based Questions
Values-based questions openly examine whether or not your values are a good match with the organization’s values.

The good news is that the responses you’ve prepared for the “prior experience” questions can also work well for values-based questions. This is the time for you to refer to your list of the organization’s values from your homework.

Yes, you will want to use the organization’s lingo (can be found on their website and/or social media) in your responses as it shows an understanding of the organization and an ability to meld into their culture.

Please do not confuse this with being phony, it is not the same thing. Instead, you are simply placing your knowledge and experiences into a framework that is familiar to the interviewer.

### Samples
If one of the organization’s values is, “Act like an owner,” and you are sharing a time when you were responsible for something, you can describe it by saying, “I owned…”.

If the organization’s value is, “Continuous Improvement,” and you are giving an example of a problem you solved, it might fit to say something like, “this was a one-time fix for the problem, but in order to continuously improve, we monitored the results daily to understand early indicators.”

#### Q: Give me an example of an org culture where you felt like you could do your best work. What was it about the culture that allowed you to perform well?
* EM Response -1 : In my current job, two of the company values are ownership and shared responsibility. I’ve been able to leverage these in the way that I manage my team. For example, we run 3-week sprints. For every sprint, we rotate the Sprint Manager role. This means that every team member has the experience of being responsible for a release from sprint planning through to the retrospective. They all gain faciliation skills which makes them more accountable to each other because they know it will soon be their turn. We also do a lot of mentorship. When we onboard a new engineer, I ask a senior engineer to be that person’s mentor for the first 6 months. The mentor is expected to be their go-to person to make sure they are comfortable asking for help. The mentor also includes the new person in meetings, as an observer, so that they can see processes in practice. Mentors introduce new employees to people across the organization and help get their internal network started. The mentorship opportunity can be a stepping stone to a Team Lead or Manager role. The company values of shared responsibility and ownership allow me to distribute leadership tasks across the team, which empowers them and leads to growth and development.
* Product Owner Response -2 : At XYZ healthcare, the passion for the mission drove everything. Everyone was encouraged to empathize with the patient – all the time, for every part of the experience. We took the patient journey very seriously. In meetings, it was common to hear, “Would you be ok if this was your loved one?” “How might we solve this if this was your mother?” Everyone was empowered to ask those questions. The constant focus on a real person improved our design decisions. We always said “patient," never “user." We had a lot of freedom for rough prototyping, and we spent time imagining we were 8 or 80, experiencing different health problems. I learned a lot about how different people perceive and report pain or discomfort or fear. My admiration and respect for healthcare workers really grew. They often helped us experiment. Sometimes we were solving for their pain points and it was still clear that we were serving the patient. It was very motivating to be part of a shared commitment to a high standard of service, and I would bring that commitment to this role.
* Project Manager Response -3 : When you’re a project manager, you have all of the accountability and none of the authority. You’re responsible for delivering work done by cross-functional teams and none of the resources report to you. It’s all about your ability to influence others. At both S Compnay and W Corp, projects required a sponsor or champion. This wasn’t just the person providing the budget. The project sponsor was an executive who was accountable for delivering the project. This person was on the hook for results as much as I was. The portfolio was prioritized rigorously, so we all knew which projects trumped others. Culturally, this created support for cross-functional teamwork and collaboration. This meant that someone who wasn’t your boss could have your back or be a champion for your work. The sponsor was an escalation point for negotiating tradeoffs. Sponsors were evaluated on their ability to deliver, and every leader had projects, so they were motivated to work with each other. There was a lot of communication about the status of active projects, which created transparency. It was easy to understand what work was important to the company, and you felt like you were contributing to all of it. There were lots of opportunities to build relationships with leaders across the organization and high perfomers were more visible. Sponsors listened to team members, asked for recommendations, and respected the people on the ground. I was empowered because there were lots of examples of leaders getting things done through influence rather than direct authority.
* Software Engineer Response -4 : When I was at ABC Foundation, there was a real focus on sharing information. We worked in teams of 8-10 people, each with a Lead. Leads reported up to managers that had two or three teams. The culture was very collaborative. Everybody worked on everything, so you got to know each other’s code and areas of expertise. If you discovered a new problem or way to do something, you were expected to add it to the KB. There was less reliance on tribal knowledge than there is at other places I’ve worked. There was no pressure to act like you know everything. If you had a question, you owned the question until it was answered, and then you were responsible for documenting the answer so others would have it. It wasn’t ok to just pose a question and be stuck if nobody responded. I got better at writing code other people could follow. My documentation really improved. We debated things and tested new ideas, but it wasn’t about something being right or winning an argument. It was about finding the best way to do something, which is really satisfying to me. If I were to join your company, I would hope to foster the same behaviors.

## Asking Questions
* Rule #1: Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer.
* Rule #2: If, during the interview, you have developed a good rapport and natural curiosity about the interviewer or something that the interviewer said, ask that question instead of a prepared one.
* Rule #3: The best method is to ask your interviewer questions that give them a chance to talk about themselves. This helps you avoid asking questions about things that you could have easily learned from their website. It also demonstrates relationship-building skills and gives you a reason to be genuine. Luckily, asking questions about another person’s experiences or opinions comes naturally in conversation – don’t overthink it, be human.
* Rule #4: Ask open-ended questions that elicit a response beyond “yes” or “no.”
* Rule #5: This is not the time to ask questions about compensation, hours, perks, or titles. Asking such questions could potentially plant ideas about your motivations and drivers that may work against you. Instead, ask questions that are in the same context as the behavioral interview. This is your chance to find out if the organization’s values are just marketing buzzwords or truly a part of the culture.


### Sample Questions Asked

* If you are looking for a bolder conversational point, give this a try:
  Is there anything about my background or resume that makes you question whether or not I am a good fit for this role?
  This question displays that you’re very interested in the job and committed to understanding your prospects as a candidate. Plus, it will allow you an opportunity to respond to any potential concerns.

## TEST YOURSELVES
* Q: "Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way."
* R: My advisor in college was very supportive of me. She placed me in positions where I would succeed. Even when I didn’t know it, my advisor was always looking for ways that she could help me build my resume. Whenever my advisor sent an opportunity my way, I would take it and try to make the best out of it. Since I knew that her career had been very similar to what I wanted to go into, I fully trusted her and the opportunities that she brought to the table. With the help of my advisor’s recommendations, I was able to secure a good job right out of college. Even though I had only just graduated, I left college with a full resume that made me marketable and brought me to a great, full-time position.
